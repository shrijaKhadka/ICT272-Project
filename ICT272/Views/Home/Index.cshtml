        There is no greater location than this: The iconic Sydney Harbor is directly outside our award-winning Central Business District Hotel, and The Rocks and Circular Quay are right across the street.
        Explore the local shopping, outdoor activities, and thriving social scene before meeting back at Mode Kitchen & Bar for delicious, regional food and beverages at Grain.
        Work and enjoyment are never too far apart in Sydney. And we like it just the way it is.
